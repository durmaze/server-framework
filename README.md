server-framework
================
Server Framework is a server-side application development framework, that incorporates various server-side development models, including commanding and pipeline based development, controller-action paradigm, and extensible, multi-protocol channel architecture. 

Server Framework offers a highly extensible, pluggable, POJO-based, Dependency Injection (DI) and unit test friendly development environment. Different type of servers can be designed, such as single-server hosting (via connectors/composite connectors, sharing different or same worker pool), multiple-server hosting, processing-based servers, command-based and/or controller-based servers, etc. 

Other supported features are request pipeline processing (i.e., request or command validation, filtering and action), content-based routing (CBR), parameter or command binding, logging and exception management.
